All about the 49ers.I was given a specific task to correlate game data from the 49ers.  The concentration was to focus on the relationship between where the location of the games were, an how it was affected by weather and if that factored on the over under of the games.Extract.  I was able to find data on two specific sites that gave a robust amount of data in regards to scores, locations, outcomes of the games.  The data was in the form of a downloadable csv file, which was compiled by specific parameter needed.  I chose for this subset the last 3 years, analyze this data.  These 3 years were important since it was the 3 years coached by the current head coach.  Each head coach has a specific emphasis on offensive and defensive calling.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/2016.htmhttps://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/2017.htmhttps://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/2018.htmhttps://pypi.org/project/sportsreference/http://www.nflweather.com/en/searches/100725One of the main concerns were to join the csv files into one database.  Each had different fields.  I chose to keep them separate but provide a primary key of opponents as the primary key. The database created was a relational database.  Some of the key columns were the dates of the games, the outcome score, and weather.  An important column is the covered/not covered column which will help determine if an upcoming game played against has a high probability of that outcome, in comparison to past data.TransformUsing python and a pandas extension, I was able to delete columns that did not have an effect on this analysis.  Having multiple years of data, was easy to cull and munge thru with either joining of dataframes, or a simpler process with excel manipulation.Transferred data into a Postgres database for easy query.LoadUsing python and sqlalchemy, the user is able to find games against teams and be able to determine if the outcome will cover or not.
